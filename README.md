## Key Features & Practices 📋

### 0. Declarative Programming
   - **Redability** Readability First: I am a developer who prioritizes clean, readable code above all. My approach is to write code that’s not only scalable but also intuitive and minimalistic, ensuring that every line serves a purpose and can be easily understood, maintained, and extended by others.


### 1. Esbuild
   - **Why Esbuild?** Esbuild is a powerful bundler that enhances build speed and efficiency, significantly reducing development and deployment times.

### 2. SSR Hydration 🌊
   - **Hydration Explanation**: Implemented Server-Side Rendering (SSR) hydration to improve initial load times and SEO. This process rehydrates the server-rendered HTML on the client side, making the app fully interactive.

### 3. Yarn 4 Installation
   - **Yarn 4**: Upgraded to Yarn 4 for faster dependency resolution and enhanced workspace management, providing a seamless development experience.

### 4. NX Integration with GitHub Actions and Cloud 🚀
   - **Nx & CI/CD**: Configured Nx with GitHub Actions and Nx Cloud for continuous integration and deployment, streamlining the development workflow with automated testing and builds.

### 5. GoDaddy Hosting & DNS Configuration 🌐
   - **DNS & Hosting**: Set up hosting on GoDaddy with custom DNS configurations, ensuring smooth and secure domain management.

### 6. Firebase Redirect Configuration
   - **Redirection**: Configured Firebase to redirect `@.com` instead of `www.@.com`, optimizing for user-friendly URLs.

### 7. Custom Scripts Creation 📝
   - **Automation Scripts**: Developed custom scripts for streamlined operations, including build, test, and deployment tasks.

### 8. Firebase Hosting & Deploy Configuration
   - **Hosting on Firebase**: Leveraged Firebase Hosting for its reliability and simplicity, with a tailored deployment configuration for a smooth release process.

### 9. GitHub Branch Protection Rules 🛡️
   - **Branch Security**: Applied branch protection rules to enforce code quality standards and maintain project integrity.

### 10. Firebase GitHub Actions 🤖
   - **Firebase CI Integration**: Set up GitHub Actions specifically for Firebase to automate build and deployment processes.

### 11. Consistent Naming Conventions
   - **Naming Best Practices**: Adopted a structured naming convention for classes and prefixes for components to improve code readability and consistency.

### 12. Firebase Configuration 🔧
   - **Centralized Config**: Managed Firebase configuration efficiently, ensuring a streamlined setup across development and production environments.

### 13. Minting SSL Certificates 🔒
   - **Certificate Management**: Successfully minted SSL certificates for secure, HTTPS-enabled hosting.

### 14. Troubleshooting GitHub Actions with Personal Access Tokens
   - **CI Solution**: Resolved GitHub Action issues by integrating a personal access token, ensuring stable connectivity with GitHub Actions and Nx Cloud tokens.

### 15. Commit-Driven Development (CDD) 📜
   - **CDD Approach**: Followed a CDD approach with meaningful commits under 50 characters, promoting clear version history.

### 16. Zero-Warning Policy 🚫
   - **Strict Code Standards**: Committed to a zero-warning codebase, allowing exceptions only for essential dependencies (e.g., `undici` as a CommonJS dependency).

### 17. Well-Structured Services
   - **Service Architecture**: Organized services within a clear structure, facilitating scalable and maintainable code.

### 18. Component Store for State Management 🗃️
   - **State Management**: Utilized a component store approach, applying declarative programming principles for predictable state management.

### 19. Web Streams Polyfill Solution for `undici`
   - **Polyfill Exploration**: Investigated and implemented web streams polyfills for `undici`, ensuring compatibility across environments.
